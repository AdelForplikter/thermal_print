# Experiments with thermal printers

## Goal
The goal with this repository is to be able to print different types of thermal label stickers in the following formats:

* 40mm X 30mm Square
* 40mm X 20mm Square
* 40mm X 20mm Round

## Hardware
### Printers
The printers I will be working on are: 
* Epson TM-T20III
* XP-T80Q (Cheap Printer from Aliexpress)

### Operating System
Windows 11

### Notes
The XP-T80Q was a little harder to set up because of driver availability, but once I got it working the print quality was exactly the same between the 2 printers.

### 3d print
Since the smaller width labels don't fit the 80mm printers, I made a universal spring loaded fixture to clamp them to the left wall of the printers.

Description of the parts:
I used 2 materials. PETG for the rigid parts
TPU for the non-rigid.
* Body1 - I cut a PVC-pipe to 54mm and used that. But you could print this in PLA/PETG too.
* Body2 - Just a model of the spring. It should be around 30mm and fit in the 7mm hole. I use a 5.5mm Ã˜ spring that is 30mm long.
* Body3 - Spring housing. PLA/PETG
* Body4 - Inner cap with spring guidance. PLA/PETG
* Body5 - Inner cap - PLA/PETG
* Body6 - Outer cap - PLA/PETG
* Body7 - Sliding Ring - TPU
* Body8 - Extension Cap - TPU
