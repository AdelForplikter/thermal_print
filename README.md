# Experiments with thermal printers

## Goal
The goal with this repository is to be able to print different types of thermal label stickers in the following formats:

* 40mm X 30mm Square
* 40mm X 20mm Square
* 40mm X 20mm Round

## Hardware

### Printers
The printers I will be working on are: 
* Epson TM-T20III
* XP-T80Q (Cheap Printer from Aliexpress)

### Notes
The XP-T80Q was a little harder to set up because of driver availability. Out of the box, the printers seemed exactly alike regarding print quality. However, the Epson TM-T20III comes with a print utility that lets you turn down the speed from 13 to 1 and also adjust the print density from 4(default) to 7(maximum). This significantly improved the prints on sticker labels that were barely readable using the default settings on both printers. 

### 3d print
Since the smaller width labels don't fit the 80mm printers, I made a universal spring loaded fixture to clamp them to the left wall of the printers.

[Step file](thermal_printer_spring.step)

Description of the parts:
I used 2 materials. PETG for the rigid parts
TPU for the non-rigid.
* Body1 - I cut a PVC-pipe to 54mm and used that. But you could print this in PLA/PETG too.
* Body2 - Just a model of the spring. It should be around 30mm and fit in the 7mm hole. I use a 5.5mm Ã˜ spring that is 30mm long.
* Body3 - Spring housing. PLA/PETG
* Body4 - Inner cap with spring guidance. PLA/PETG
* Body5 - Inner cap - PLA/PETG
* Body6 - Outer cap - PLA/PETG
* Body7 - Sliding Ring - TPU
* Body8 - Extension Cap - TPU

## Software

### Github
The project lives here: [https://github.com/AdelForplikter/thermal_print.git](https://github.com/AdelForplikter/thermal_print.git)

### Operating System
Windows 11



### Python
    pwsh> python -m venv ./venv

    pwsh> .\venv\Scripts\activate

    pwsh> pip install python-escpos\[all\] # Epson Standard Code for Point of Sale. 

    pwsh> pip install pyusb # USB printer

    pwsh> pip install pillow # Image generation

    pwsh> pip install flask # Exposing web interface

    pwsh> pip install gunicorn # Web Server Gateway Interface HTTP server (WSGI)


### Usb
If you want to use Usb in windows, open computer management - Universial Serial 
Bus Controllers. Find correct printer and right click properties. Then under 
Hardware Ids you can find the idVendor and idProduct. They look like this: 
USB\VID_1FC9&PID_2016&REV_0200

idVendor = 0x1FC9

idProduct = 0x2016

## images
The fonts out of the box are pretty bad for these printers. Therefore it's best to create small images with custom fonts and art of our choosing as all printers can print these. This is especially cruial when printing stickers as it gives us fine control of both height and width by adjusting the image size. DPI is 203 which means that a 40mm x 30mm sticker needs an image of 320px x 240px. Then we also adjust for the space between the stickers (if any). A gap of 6mm gives us a 40mm x 36mm image which in 203dpi translates to 320px x 288px

### Docker
We need to pass usb from windows to wsl to use it in docker

[https://learn.microsoft.com/nb-no/windows/wsl/connect-usb#attach-a-usb-device](https://learn.microsoft.com/nb-no/windows/wsl/connect-usb#attach-a-usb-device)

    pwsh> winget install usbipd

    pwsh> usbipd list

    pwsh> usbipd bind --busid 1-3

    pwsh> usbipd bind --busid 1-7

    pwsh> usbipd attach --wsl --busid 1-3

    pwsh> usbipd attach --wsl --busid 1-7

    wsl@yellowhand: lsusb

> Bus 001 Device 003: ID 1fc9:2016 NXP Semiconductors USB Printer Port

> Bus 001 Device 002: ID 04b8:0e28 Seiko Epson Corp. TM-T20III

Now wsl has access to the USB. The only thing remaining is passing it to the docker container. The --privileged is necessary or you won't get the access you need to the usb. Be aware that this may be a security risk. 

    wsl@yellowhand: docker run -i -t --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb -p 5000:5000 flaskapp

I also switched from using the Win32Raw driver to Usb in app.py

The fonts were used directly from the c:\windows\fonts-directory earlier and were moved to ./static/fonts to be available from the docker-image. app.py was also updated. 

#### Dockerfile
To rebuild the docker image: 

    docker build -t flaskapp

#### compose.yaml

Added a compose.yaml:

    docker compose up -d
    
    docker compose down
